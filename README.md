### You will build a Web API in coordination with the front end team.

The API should provide the endpoints that the front end needs to complete client requirements and demonstrate your proficiency in the skills you've learned so far.

The API should be built using the REST architectural pattern, provide data persistence, incorporate authentication, include automated tests and be deployed to a hosting platform of your choice.
